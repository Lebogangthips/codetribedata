 <h3> You have just landed in the future. Welcome to CodeTribe Academy! 

 </h3>

<p>CodeTribe is a collaboration between the Innovation Hub and mLab Southern Africa to
   increase the skills of talented young<br> ICT enthusiasts by providing them a learning environment 
    where they build real world products as part of a 1 year programme.</p>

<p>“The aim is to foster a culture of making within our country.<br> We need to be 
  Makers and we need to equip our youth with<br> skills and encourage them to be curious, 
  to investigate and to make rather than consume” said Aubrey Malabie, CodeTribe’s Manager 
  and one of the founders of the organization.</p>
