<h1>About us</h1>

<p>When our youth are empowered with the right skills to innovate and create solutions,
   they unlock the opportunities for new businesses that will drive our economies forward.
    This is why we support these young innovators, founders, next generation coders and digital creatives.

</p>

<p>In 2012 mLab Southern Africa (Mobile Applications Laboratory NPC) launched as a mobile technology accelerator 
  with the aim of supporting innovative new startups and to unlock the mobile apps economy. Since then we have grown
   into an open innovation lab which includes programmes that support skills development through our own and partner code
    academies, facilitated co-creation seasons with industry and public sector partners and we continue to build on our
     successes as a local tech start-up lab.</p>
